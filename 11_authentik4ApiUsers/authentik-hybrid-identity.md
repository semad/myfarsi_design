# Hybrid Identity Note

Hybrid identity planning (federating enterprise IdPs, SCIM provisioning, account linking) is documented inside the Authentik platform blueprint: see `11_athentik_user/authentication.md` under **Roadmap** and **Identity Providers & Account Strategy**.

Use this pointer when older runbooks reference the stand-alone hybrid identity doc. No independent guidance remains here; keep references aligned with the consolidated design.
