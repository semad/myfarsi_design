# Research: Improve Component Specifications

## Technology Choices

### Decision: Go for CLI Tool

- **Rationale**: The project's constitution prefers Go and CLI-driven workflows. Go is well-suited for creating performant, cross-platform CLI tools.
- **Alternatives considered**: Python with `click` or `argparse`. Go was chosen for its performance and single-binary distribution.

### Decision: `urfave/cli` for Command-Line Interface

- **Rationale**: `urfave/cli` is a popular and well-supported library for building CLI applications in Go. It provides a simple and declarative API for defining commands, flags, and arguments.
- **Alternatives considered**: `cobra`. `urfave/cli` was chosen for its simplicity and ease of use.

### Decision: `gopkg.in/yaml.v2` for YAML parsing

- **Rationale**: If the quality checklists or other configuration are stored in YAML format, this library will be used for parsing.
- **Alternatives considered**: `sigs.k8s.io/yaml`. `gopkg.in/yaml.v2` is a standard choice for YAML parsing in Go.
