# Feature Specification: Improve Component Specifications

**Feature Branch**: `001-improve-component-specs`  
**Created**: 2025-10-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Understand and read all documents here. Lets improve each one bye one. We want to improve the sepcification for all components"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-15

- Q: How should the success of this specification improvement process be tracked and measured? → A: Track reduction in clarification questions and developer onboarding time.
- Q: The specification focuses on improving existing component specifications. Should the process also cover the creation of new specifications from scratch, or is that out of scope? → A: Yes, the process should cover both improving existing and creating new specifications.
- Q: What should happen if a developer is unable to update a specification to meet the quality standards? → A: The specification is marked as "needs improvement" and a task is created to address it later.
- Q: What should happen if two developers attempt to update the same specification simultaneously? → A: Rely on the version control system to manage conflicts.
- Q: Are there any performance requirements for the process of analyzing and updating specifications? For example, should the analysis be fast? → A: No strict performance targets, but the process should be reasonably fast.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Analyze Existing Specification (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I want to analyze an existing component specification to identify its weaknesses, so that I can propose improvements.

**Why this priority**: This is the first step in improving the quality of the specifications.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by taking an existing specification and producing a list of actionable feedback based on a quality checklist.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an existing component specification and a quality checklist, **When** a developer analyzes the spec, **Then** a list of specific, actionable improvements is generated.
2. **Given** a specification with missing sections, **When** a developer analyzes it, **Then** the missing sections are identified as a required improvement.

### User Story 2 - Update Specification (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I want to update a component specification to meet the quality standards, so that it is clear, complete, and useful for development and testing.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value of the feature - actually improving the specifications.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by taking a specification with a list of required improvements and producing an updated specification that addresses them.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a component specification and a list of required improvements, **When** a developer updates the spec, **Then** the updated spec passes the quality checklist.

---

### User Story 3 - Create New Specification (Priority: P3)

As a developer, I want to create a new component specification from scratch that meets the quality standards, so that the new component is well-documented from the start.

**Why this priority**: This is important for new components, but improving existing specs is a higher priority.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a new specification for a new component and verifying that it passes the quality checklist.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new component without a specification, **When** a developer creates a new spec, **Then** the new spec passes the quality checklist.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a standardized quality checklist for component specifications.
- **FR-002**: The analysis process MUST compare the specification against each item in the quality checklist.
- **FR-003**: The output of the analysis MUST be a list of concrete, actionable improvements.
- **FR-004**: The updated specification MUST incorporate the proposed improvements and meet all quality criteria.
- **FR-005**: The process MUST be applicable to any component specification in the repository.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST provide a template for creating new component specifications.
- **FR-007**: If a specification fails to meet the quality standards, it MUST be marked as "needs improvement" and a task MUST be created to track the required work.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: The process of analyzing and updating specifications should be reasonably fast to not discourage its use, but there are no strict performance targets.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Component Specification**: The markdown file containing the specification for a single component.
- **Quality Checklist**: A markdown file that lists the criteria for a good specification.

### Edge Cases

- How does the process for creating a new specification differ from improving an existing one?
- What happens if a specification is so outdated that it is easier to rewrite it from scratch?

### Assumptions

- There is a defined set of components that need their specifications improved.
- Developers have the necessary permissions to update the specifications.
- The version control system will be used to handle conflicts arising from simultaneous edits of the same specification.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Reduce the number of clarification questions during the development of a component by 30%, tracked via developer surveys and a review of meeting notes.
- **SC-002**: 95% of all component specifications pass the quality checklist.
- **SC-003**: Reduce the onboarding time for a new developer on a component by 20%, as measured by the time it takes for a new developer to make their first significant contribution.
