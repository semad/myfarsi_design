# Tasks: Improve Component Specifications

**Feature**: Improve Component Specifications

This file breaks down the implementation of the Specification Improver tool into actionable, dependency-ordered tasks.

## Phase 1: Setup

- [x] T001 Create the project structure in `src/spec-improver/` as defined in the implementation plan.
- [x] T002 Initialize the Go module: `go mod init github.com/your-org/spec-improver` in `src/spec-improver/`
- [x] T003 Add dependencies: `go get urfave/cli/v2 gopkg.in/yaml.v2` in `src/spec-improver/`

## Phase 2: Foundational

- [x] T004 [P] Implement the Quality Checklist model and parser in `src/spec-improver/pkg/checklist/checklist.go`
- [x] T005 [P] Create a basic CLI structure in `src/spec-improver/cmd/spec-improver/main.go`

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Analyze Existing Specification

**Goal**: Analyze an existing component specification to identify its weaknesses.
**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running the `analyze` command on a sample spec file.

- [x] T006 [US1] Implement the `analyze` command in `src/spec-improver/cmd/spec-improver/main.go`
- [x] T007 [US1] Implement the core analysis logic in `src/spec-improver/internal/analyzer/analyzer.go`

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Update Specification

**Goal**: Update a component specification to meet quality standards.
**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running the `update` command on a sample spec file with a list of improvements.

- [x] T008 [US2] Implement the `update` command in `src/spec-improver/cmd/spec-improver/main.go`

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Create New Specification

**Goal**: Create a new component specification from scratch.
**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running the `create` command and checking the output file.

- [x] T009 [US3] Implement the `create` command in `src/spec-improver/cmd/spec-improver/main.go`
- [x] T010 [US3] Implement the logic for creating a new spec from a template in `src/spec-improver/internal/creator/creator.go`
- [x] T011 [US3] Add the spec template to `src/spec-improver/internal/templates/spec.md`

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

- [x] T012 [P] Add unit tests for the `analyzer`, `creator`, and `checklist` packages in the `tests/unit/` directory.
- [x] T013 [P] Add integration tests for the CLI commands in the `tests/integration/` directory.
- [x] T014 Write the `README.md` for the `spec-improver` tool.

## Dependencies

- User Story 1 (Analyze) is a prerequisite for User Story 2 (Update).
- User Story 3 (Create) is independent of the other two.

## Parallel Execution

- The foundational work (T004, T005) can be done in parallel.
- The implementation of the three user stories can be parallelized after the foundational work is complete.
- All testing tasks (T012, T013) can be done in parallel.

## Implementation Strategy

The recommended approach is to implement the user stories in priority order, starting with User Story 1 as the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). This will provide value early by allowing developers to start analyzing their existing specifications.
